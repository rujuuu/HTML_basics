    <p>
        I don’t know what to feel,<br>
        I am tired yet hopeful,<br>
        Driven yet so out of sync,<br>
        Filled with nothing but regret.
    </p>

    <p>
        As I sat and ponder what’s going on in my head,<br>
        I accepted the fact there was nothing to read.<br>
        Nothing was here, and nothing will fill.<br>
        Monsters lurk, they won’t stay still.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this vast and open world with endless possibilities,<br>
        I am nothing but a mere speck of dust.<br>
        It’s not even enough to even cause any allergies,<br>
        I am just here, and here I am to last.
    </p>

    <p>
        Like a train, I long for a track;<br>
        With no clear path ahead, I feel lost.<br>
        I am lucky to have people behind my back—<br>
        I am so out of breath, I feel lost.
    </p>
